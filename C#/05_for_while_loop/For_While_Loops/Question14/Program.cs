         * if $1,000 is invested in a bank account for 10 years. 
         * Your program should display the amounts available for interest rates from 6 percent to 12 percent inclusively, 
         * at 1 percent increments. Use a nested loop, with the outer loop having a fixed count of 7 
         * and the inner loop a fixed count of 10. 
         * The first iteration of the outer loop should use an interest rate of 6 percent 
         * and display the amount of money available at the end of the first 10 years. 
         * In each subsequent pass through the outer loop, the interest rate should be increased by 1 percent.
         * Use the relationship that the money available at the end of each year equals the amount of money in the account 
         * at the start of the year plus the interest rate times the amount available at the start of the year.
           The output of this program should be in the form of a table.
